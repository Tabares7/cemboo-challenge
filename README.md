# Cemboo - Frontend Development Task

## Create a Streaming App

**Note:** You don’t need to stick to exact specifications; you can innovate as you like as long as you follow the main idea of the task.

### Objective

Your task is to create a single-page streaming app. You can refer to platforms like Netflix, Viki, Hotstar, etc.

### Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TypeScript**

In addition to these, there are no restrictions. You can use any library or technology that complements these two technologies.

### Guidelines

1. **Mock the API requests** (don’t create any backend).
2. **Dummy Data:** [Dummy Data Link](https://pastecode.io/s/4owen59r)
3. **Handle CORS issue:** Use this endpoint [Dummy REST API Example](https://dummy.restapiexample.com/). Even if there is no CORS issue with this link, assume that it exists and handle it accordingly.
4. You don’t need to utilize the data anywhere, just call the API somewhere and output it in the console.

### Project Requirements

1. **Hero Banner**

   - Something similar to the streaming platforms.

2. **Media Items Carousels** (multiple)

   - Items should have hover previews as well.

3. **Navigation**

   - No functional links are required; navigation will not be active.

4. **Video Modal**
   - When you click on any media item, a modal will open, which will have any YouTube video and a simple title.
   - All screenshots are only to demonstrate which part of the streaming platform I am referring to; you don’t need to create the exact same UI.

### Judging Criteria

1. **Code Quality:**

   - Assessing readability, maintainability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

2. **UX Quality:**

   - Ensuring fluidity in transitions, intuitive interfaces, and responsive feedback mechanisms.

3. **Responsiveness:**
   - Focusing on proper functionality across standard 1080p displays and mobile devices.
   - Compatibility with both touch and mouse inputs is essential.

Rest assured that whichever design you choose to go with, even if it’s a mix and match from various platforms, you won't be solely judged on that, so feel free to use any design.
